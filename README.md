# Tic Tac Toe Game in Assembly x64

This is a simple implementation of the classic terminal based Tic Tac Toe game in Assembly, playable against another player or against an amazing(?) AI that I implemented. 

> Note: I was going to add difficulty levels for the AI, but not now. Maybe I can add those later. Current AI is not very challenging, it is focused on winning instead of preventing you from winning.

## How to Play

1. Run the file on your machine or simply use an online compiler (https://www.onlinegdb.com/).
```
   Note: A long terminal screen is recommended
```

## Features
Play against another player (turn based on the same computer) or against a basic AI.
Clear terminal screen for better visualization.
A nice UI.

## File Structure
**tictactoe.S:** Contains the source code for the game, good luck with trying to figure out the source code.

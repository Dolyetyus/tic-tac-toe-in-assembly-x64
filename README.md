# Tic Tac Toe Game in Assembly x64

This is a simple implementation of the classic terminal based Tic Tac Toe game in Assembly, playable against another player or against an amazing(?) AI that I implemented.

A few days ago, I saw a video of a guy with the caption "When you realise you spent 13 hours coding a tic tac toe" and there was a comment saying "Probably he coded it in Assembly ðŸ’€". After reading this comment, I wanted to give it a try and here is my terminal based tic tac toe game, implemented using Assembly x64 in only almost 5 hours.

> Note: I was going to add difficulty levels for the AI, but not now. Maybe I can add those later. Current AI is not very challenging, it is focused on winning instead of preventing you from winning.
